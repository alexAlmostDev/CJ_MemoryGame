# Memory game with cards

Inspired by Coding Garden video, I thought it was a fun project and this is my first time ever making any sort of game.
<br>
I gotta say, besides my usual fight with CSS, figuring out the logic in the javascript also took me some time.
<br><br>
In the end everything worked out, live demo here: [<https://alexjunior.dev/memory>](https://alexjunior.dev/memory)
